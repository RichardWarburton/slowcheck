Slowcheck
=========

Slowcheck is a Java wrapper around the Scala automated unit testing framework [Scalacheck](http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/).

It is possible to run the Scalacheck code directly from Java, however it becomes incredibly ugly and non-idiomatic.  Slowcheck attempts to address this problem.
